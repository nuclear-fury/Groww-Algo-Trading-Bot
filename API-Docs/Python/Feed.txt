Title: Feed - Groww API

URL Source: http://groww.in/trade-api/docs/python-sdk/feed

Markdown Content:
The Groww Feed provides methods to subscribe to and receive Groww data streams and updates.

Once you have your [API key](https://groww.in/trade-api/docs/python-sdk#getting-started), you can use the `GrowwFeed` client to subscribe to live data streams and receive updates.

The Feed Client can either be used synchronously to get the last updated data or asynchronously to trigger a callback whenever new data is received.

To use the methods in Feed Client, you need a exchange token for the corresponding instrument. You can get the exchange token of a particular instrument from the instruments csv [file](https://growwapi-assets.groww.in/instruments/instrument.csv).

You can subscribe for up to 1000 instruments at a time.

The SDK provides methods to subscribe to and receive live data streams using the `GrowwFeed` class accessible from the `growwapi` module.

1.   Live Data: Subscribe to, get, and unsubscribe from the live data of Derivatives, Stocks and Indices. Each of them support subscribing, getting data and unsubscribing for multiple instruments in one go.
2.   Order updates of Derivatives and Equity and also Position updates of Derivatives.

Subscribe and get the live data of equity, index and derivatives.
