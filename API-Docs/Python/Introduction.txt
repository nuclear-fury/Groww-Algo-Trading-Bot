Welcome to the Groww Trading API! Our APIs enable you to build and automate trading strategies with seamless access to real-time market data, order placement, portfolio management, and more. Whether you're an experienced algo trader or just starting with automation, Groww's API is designed to be simple, powerful, and developer-friendly.

This SDK wraps our REST-like APIs into easy-to-use Python methods, allowing you to focus on building your trading applications without worrying about the underlying API implementation details.

### [Step 1: Prerequisites](http://groww.in/trade-api/docs/python-sdk#step-1-prerequisites)

Trading on Groww using Groww APIs requires:

*   A Groww account with F&O trading enabled.
*   Basic knowledge of Python and REST APIs.
*   A development environment with Python 3.7+ installed.

### [Step 2: Generate your Token](http://groww.in/trade-api/docs/python-sdk#step-2-generate-your-token)

To generate an API access token:

*   Log in to your Groww account.
*   Click on the profile section at the Right-top of your screen.
*   Click on the setting icon in the menu.
*   In the navigation list, select ‘Trading APIs’

You can create, revoke and manage all your tokens from this [page](https://groww.in/user/profile/trading-apis).

### [Step 3: Install the Python SDK](http://groww.in/trade-api/docs/python-sdk#step-3-install-the-python-sdk)

You can install the Python SDK by running this command on your terminal/command prompt.

### [Step 4: Place your First Order](http://groww.in/trade-api/docs/python-sdk#step-4-place-your-first-order)

Use this sample code to place an order.

The rate limits are applied at the type level, not on individual APIs. This means that all APIs grouped under a type (e.g., Orders, Live Data, Non Trading) share the same limit. If the limit for one API within a type is exhausted, all other APIs in that type will also be rate-limited until the limit window resets.

| Type | Requests | Limit (Per second) | Limit (Per minute) | Limit (Per Day) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Orders | Create, Modify and Cancel Order | 15 | 250 | 3000 |
| Live Data | Market Quote, LTP, OHLC | 10 | 300 | 5000 |
| Non Trading | Order Status, Order list, Trade list, Positions, Holdings, Margin | 10 | 250 | 3000 |
