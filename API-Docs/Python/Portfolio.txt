Title: Portfolio - Groww API

Markdown Content:
This guide describes how to get detailed information about your holdings and positions using our Python SDK.

Use the `get_holdings_for_user` method to fetch your current holdings quickly and see all your stocks in one place.

Holdings represent the user's collection of long-term equity delivery stocks. An asset in a holdings portfolio stays there indefinitely unless it is sold, delisted, or modified by the exchanges. Fundamentally, the assets in the holdings are stored in the user's DEMAT account, as processed by exchanges and clearing institutions.
